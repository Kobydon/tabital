"""Instalment deferment (CLAUDE.md §4, interim rule §13 #8).

A customer may pay a deferment fee (10% of the instalment) to push an upcoming instalment back
a month. The deferred instalment and every unpaid instalment after it move by the same amount,
so no two payments land in the same month. The deferment isn't a late payment, so it doesn't
lower the limit or tier.

Rules (all settings, pending founder confirmation):
- deferment_fee_percentage (10), deferment_max_per_plan (1), deferment_months (1)
- only an upcoming instalment (not Payment 1), on or before its due date, with no late fee
- the plan must be active, not paused by a dispute, with nothing overdue
- the fee is paid up front through Paystack; the deferment applies once Paystack confirms it
