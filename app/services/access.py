"""Management Access (founder, 2026-09-27).

"All approvals, settings and rates, highly sensitive information and changes are reserved for
Management Access." Admin accounts have an admin_level:

- management: everything.
- operations: can read every admin queue (with personal data masked, services/pii.py), send
  payment reminders and add customer notes. Nothing else.

The rule is enforced once for every request (app/__init__.py register_access_control), so a new
endpoint is management-only unless it's added to OPERATIONS_WRITES. That keeps the safe default.
