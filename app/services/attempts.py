"""Slowing down guessing: passwords, password-reset codes and sign-ups.

Each attempt is written (as a failure) **before** the password or code is checked, then counted, so
parallel requests can't slip past the limit; a correct answer flips it to success.

- Per account: counted on the account (user id) when it exists, so phone and email share one limit,
  and on the typed identifier when it doesn't (the answer is the same either way).
- Per IP: only when one address fails on many different accounts (password spraying). Accounts that
  have signed in successfully from that address before keep working, so people sharing a mobile
  network address (CGNAT) aren't locked out by someone else.
- A successful password reset clears an account's lock, so a lock can't be used to keep someone out.

The client IP comes from X-Forwarded-For with TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT hops (Render: 1). Set it to 0 if
the app is ever reached without a proxy, or clients could choose their own address.
